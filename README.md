This is a version of the Lola-2 compiler by Prof. Wirth translated to C++ using https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon with a few manual adjustments. 

The original Oberon-07 source code of the compiler was downloaded from https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/Lola/index.html on 2018-12-28 and included in the Original subdirectory for convenience. 

The Examples subdirectory includes the original RISC5 Lola-2 files written by Prof. Wirth and a version translated to Verilog using this C++ version of the Lola-2 compiler.

To build just download all files and run make with the provided Makefile. The code complies with C++03 and there are no other dependencies than the C++ standard library.
